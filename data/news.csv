With a net worth of more than $100 billion, recent stock purchases over the last 15 years have helped Buffett’s wealth massively increase. So what exactly is his investment philosophy? It’s centered around the principle of value investing, which involves finding undervalued companies that focus on long-term earnings rather than short-term growth. In other words, rather than buying stocks, he buys businesses that have a competitive advantage. This approach has made him one of the most successful investors in history, and anyone can invest like him by following his strategies. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer zeroes in on the big companies Warren Buffett invests in, including Costco (COST) and Coca-Cola (KO), and breaks down why his investment strategy works, but also, can sometimes cause him to miss out on some big winners.;Wed, 03 May 2023 14:47:43 +0000;NFLX_2023-05-03;0.9397;0.3612
